This module allows for easy editing of smb.conf in an OO way.
The need arised from openfiler http://www.openfiler.org which at this current
time setups a smb conf for you, however any changes you made by hand are lost
when you make change due to the fact it doesnt havea way to edit an existing
smb.conf but simply creates a new one. This modules allows for any program to
be ables to extract the current config, make changes nd save the file. Comments
are lost however on save.
