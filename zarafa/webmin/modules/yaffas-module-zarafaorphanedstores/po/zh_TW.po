msgid "This is a list of all zarafa stores which are not hooked to any user. Usually this happens when users are deleted. You have the option to delete these stores, hook them to another user or copy them to the public store. Hooking a orphaned store to a user will make the orphaned store the user's new store. The user's old store will in turn be orphaned."
msgstr "這是未掛至任何用戶之全部Zarafa儲存列表，這通常發生在用戶被刪除時。您可選擇刪除這些儲存、將其掛至另一用戶或將其複製至公共儲存。如將孤立儲存掛到一用戶，將使此孤立儲存成為此用戶之新儲存，此用戶之舊儲存將轉變成孤立。"
