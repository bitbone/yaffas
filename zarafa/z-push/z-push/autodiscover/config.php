 *  LOGLEVEL_FATAL          - log only critical errors
 *  LOGLEVEL_ERROR          - logs events which might require corrective actions
 *  LOGLEVEL_WARN           - might lead to an error or require corrective actions in the future
 *  LOGLEVEL_INFO           - usually completed actions
 *  LOGLEVEL_DEBUG          - debugging information, typically only meaningful to developers
 *  LOGLEVEL_WBXML          - also prints the WBXML sent to/from the device
 *  LOGLEVEL_DEVICEID       - also prints the device id for every log entry
 *  LOGLEVEL_WBXMLSTACK     - also prints the contents of WBXML stack
 *
 *  The verbosity increases from top to bottom. More verbose levels include less verbose
 *  ones, e.g. setting to LOGLEVEL_DEBUG will also output LOGLEVEL_FATAL, LOGLEVEL_ERROR,
 *  LOGLEVEL_WARN and LOGLEVEL_INFO level entries.
