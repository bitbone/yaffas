== Installation


=== System requirements

  * Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  * about 22 MB of additional disk space


=== Procedure

Yaffas can be installed from the repositories described below.


==== Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS

**adding required repositories**

  echo "deb http://repo.yaffas.org/ubuntu ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
  echo "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

**import package key**

  wget -O - http://repo.yaffas.org/ubuntu/repo.key | apt-key add -

**install the packages**

  apt-get update
  apt-get install yaffas yaffas-zarafa

This will install {product} base modules and zarafa.

**optional: installing the configuration packages**

This package and its dependencies are used to make a freshly installed system manageable with {product}. Without yaffas-config, a number of manual adjustments to configuration files need to be made so the admin interface can function properly.

  apt-get install yaffas-config

Answer "yes" if the installation system asks to replace configuration files.

[WARNING]
==============

When installing the **yaffas-config** package and its dependencies, the
following settings and data will be deleted or overwritten:
 
  * existing LDAP tree
  * slapd configuration
  * Samba configuration
  * smbldap-tools configuration
  * postfix configuration
  * zarafa configuration
  * MySQL configuration (optimizations for Zarafa will be made)


==============


==== Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5

The installation on Red Hat Enterprise Linux is similar.

[WARNING]
==============

The package yaffas-config will overwrite the same configuration files as mentioned above.

==============

**adding the required repositories**

Prior to the installation of {product} Zarafa packages have to be installed. Otherwise the open source packages included in the EPEL repository will be used. Packages can  be downloaded from http://www.zarafa.com/download-release.

For automatic dependency resolution the http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL[EPEL] and http://rpmrepo.org/RPMforge[RPMforge] repositories should be included into the yum configuration.

Create a file "yaffas.repo" in folder /etc/yum.repos.d with the following contents:
----
[yaffas]
name = Yaffas $releasever
baseurl = http://repo.yaffas.org/rhel/
enabled = 1
protect = 0
gpgcheck = 0
----

**import GPG keys**

  rpm --import http://repo.yaffas.org/rhel.key

**packages installation**

  yum install yaffas yaffas-zarafa yaffas-config


=== First steps

After installation, the {product} web interface is accessible at the following URL: `https://<your-server's-ip>:10000`

The username is "admin" and password is "yaffas".

On first log in the admin password has to be changes. In addition, the user has to specify a MySQL user who has permission to create a database for Zarafa.

After the first login an authentication server should be selected. Choices are Active Directory, remote LDAP and local authentication. Please note that currently the configuration files (yaffas-config) have to be installed for this step.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux you also need to start the required services and configure them for automatic start at boot. This is can be done in "System-> Services". Since by default an iptables firewall is active in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the ports for the needed services have to be opened manually.

[IMPORTANT]
==============

The language in the {product} UI has to be set for the folders in Zarafa to be created in the right language. This should be done prior to the creation of users.
