== Installation
:images: {product@zadmin:images/:images/en/}

{product} has to be installed on a freshly set up Linux distribution.
At the moment Ubuntu 10.04/12.04, Debian 6 and Red Hat 5/6 are officially
supported.
The following steps describe how {product} can be installed.
There are packages available for both 32bit and 64bit architectures.

=== System requirements

  * Ubuntu Server 10.04/12.04, Debian 6 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5/6
  * Correctly configured fully qualified hostname
  * Static IP address

{product} can be installed on a preconfigured Zarafa system, however beware that your configuration will be overwritten and that you can loose your data.

Please also make sure that your MySQL password does not contain a hash sign (#) since there is a problem with the current configuration management.

=== Procedure

{product} can be installed from the repositories described below for the two supported Linux distributions.

==== Installation on existing server

Right now the installation on an existing server is not recommended and not supported.
Before considering to go this way, either wait for one of the next releases or install on a clean machine and migrate your data to the new system.

If you still wish to install it on an existing server make sure you have a backup or make a copy of your actual machine.

To install {product} on such a system, install the packages as described
below, but skip the installation wizard (change
/opt/yaffas/etc/webmin/webmin.acl symlink to point to
webmin.acl-global instead of -setup), as it would delete all your data.

You will have to do several configuration changes on your own. You can
figure out the necessary details by inspecting the relevant resources
(/opt/yaffas/share/yaffas-upgrade/, /opt/yaffas/share/yaffas-ldap/, and
the source code of the packages as found on http://www.github.com/bitbone/yaffas/).

We invite you to ask for community support for this installation path, which we will monitor closely on the forum and possibly create a standardized procedure from this.

==== Ubuntu Server

**Adding required repositories**

ifdef::isbeta[]
[WARNING]
==============
This is a {product} **beta** version. The following addresses are only
valid for the beta version. Once a new version is published,
the repository URL has to be **updated manually**, otherwise **no
updates**
to newer versions will be possible.
==============
endif::isbeta[]

Add the following repositories in order to install {product} and required dependencies via the standard apt commands.

_Ubuntu 10.04 LTS_

[subs="attributes"]
  echo "deb http://repo.yaffas.org/{repository_prefix}lucid ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

_Ubuntu 12.04 LTS_

[subs="attributes"]
  echo "deb http://repo.yaffas.org/{repository_prefix}precise ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

[NOTE]
===========

If you need a proxy to download from internet, just set the "http_proxy" variable

  export http_proxy="http://<user>:<password>@<your-proxy>:<port>"
  export HTTP_PROXY="$http_proxy"

You should later make this setting permanent by setting the proxy in the
user interface (Network &gt; Configuration &gt; HTTP Proxy).
This will also ensure that all supported services can properly use the
proxy (such as ClamAV's freshclam).

===========

**Import package key**

  wget -O - http://repo.yaffas.org/repo.deb.key | apt-key add -

**Install the packages**

[subs="attributes"]
  apt-get update
  apt-get install {product}

This will install {product} base modules and zarafa.

During the installation zarafa, mysql, openldap, postfix and many other dependencies are installed.

The package manager will usually ask questions for some packages.
You can skip all of these by pressing "enter" when the dialog pops up.
The configuration of these will be done by the {product} installation
procedure later.

Only if you are asked for a MySQL server root password you should enter a password and note it down as you will be asked for MySQL credentials when first using {product}.

image:{images}11_postfix_thumb.png[link="{images}11_postfix.png"]
image:{images}12_postfix_thumb.png[link="{images}12_postfix.png"]

Use the default values for kerberos configuration:

image:{images}13_kerberos_thumb.png[link="{images}13_kerberos.png"]
image:{images}14_kerberos_thumb.png[link="{images}14_kerberos.png"]
image:{images}15_kerberos_thumb.png[link="{images}15_kerberos.png"]

Add the following repositories in order to install {product} and required dependencies via the standard apt commands.

[subs="attributes"]
  echo "deb http://repo.yaffas.org/{repository_prefix}squeeze ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

[NOTE]

==== Red Hat Enterprise Linux

The installation on Red Hat Enterprise Linux is similar.

[NOTE]
===========

If you need a proxy to download from internet, just set the "http_proxy" variable

  export http_proxy="http://<user>:<password>@<your-proxy>:<port>"
  export HTTP_PROXY="$http_proxy"

You should later make this setting permanent by setting the proxy in the
user interface (Network &gt; Configuration &gt; HTTP Proxy).
This will also ensure that all supported services can properly use the
proxy (such as ClamAV's freshclam).

===========

**Adding the required repositories**

The {product} packages will require some dependencies.
As these dependencies are not part of the standard RHEL repository, the following two repositories have to be added to the installed system.

**Repositories for RHEL 5**

Run the following command to install the EPEL repository:

  rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm

If the above referenced URL is no longer functional because a newer version
of the package is available, then you can still get the latest version from
this address:
http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/repoview/epel-release.html


Then, depending on your architecture, run the following commands to add
the RPMforge repository:

  rpm -Uvh http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el5.rf.i386.rpm

or

  rpm -Uvh http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el5.rf.x86_64.rpm

**Repositories for RHEL 6**

Run the following command to install the EPEL repository:

  rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-7.noarch.rpm

If the above referenced URL is no longer functional because a newer version
of the package is available, then you can still get the latest version from
this address:
http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/repoview/epel-release.html

Then, depending on your architecture, run the following commands to add
the RPMforge repository:

  rpm -Uvh http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el6.rf.i686.rpm

or

  rpm -Uvh http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el6.rf.x86_64.rpm

[NOTE]
==============

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems it is necessary to
https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/solutions/11312[subscribe] to the
"RHEL Server Optional" channel. This is not done by default.

==============

**{product} repository**

ifdef::isbeta[]
[WARNING]
==============
This is a {product} **beta** version. The following addresses are only
valid for the beta version. Once a new version is published,
the repository URL has to be **updated manually**, otherwise **no
updates**
to newer versions will be possible.
==============
endif::isbeta[]

After the extra repositories are added, the {product} repository has to added:

Create a file "{product}.repo" in folder /etc/yum.repos.d with the following contents:
[subs="attributes"]
----
[{product}]
name = {product} $releasever
baseurl = http://repo.yaffas.org/{repository_prefix}rhel/$releasever
enabled = 1
protect = 0
gpgcheck = 1
priority = 1
----

**Import GPG keys**

  rpm --import http://repo.yaffas.org/repo.rpm.key

**Package installation**

[subs="attributes"]
  yum install {product}

[NOTE]
================

If running the above command leads to a conflict between php-common and
php53-common on RHEL5, then this is because of a
http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=4852[packaging bug]. You can work
around this by running

  yum remove php53 php53-common
  yum install php php-ldap php-mapi php-pecl-json

before re-running

[subs="attributes"]
  yum install {product}

================

=== First steps

After installation, the {product} web interface is accessible at the following URL: `https://<your-server's-ip>:10000`

The username is "admin" and password is "yaffas".

image:{images}{theme}/16_login_thumb.png[link="{images}{theme}/16_login.png"]

On first login, the setup assistant will be launched.

[WARNING]
==============

The setup procedure will change the following settings and **data will
be deleted or overwritten**:

  * existing LDAP tree
  * slapd configuration
  * Samba configuration
  * smbldap-tools configuration
  * postfix configuration
  * zarafa configuration
  * MySQL configuration (optimizations for Zarafa will be made)

==============

The installer will also ask you to change the default admin password and
you will have to specify a MySQL user who has permission to create a database for Zarafa.
The database you add here will be used for zarafa and will be created if it does not exists.

image:{images}{theme}/17_setup_thumb.png[link="{images}{theme}/17_setup.png"]

After the first login an authentication server should be selected in Accounts -> Authentication.

Choices are Active Directory, remote LDAP and local authentication.

If you select local authentication you can select if you want to use this as authentication server.
Just click on apply if you don't need that.

image:{images}{theme}/18_authserver_thumb.png[link="{images}{theme}/18_authserver.png"]

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux you also need to start the required services and configure them for automatic start at boot. This is can be done in "System -> Services".
Since by default an iptables firewall is active in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the ports for the needed services have to be opened manually.

The next step should be to configure the mail server.
Without a working mail server configuration some parts of the system will not work.
It will also not be possible to create resources for Zarafa when no local domain is set for the mail server.

Now you can go Accounts -> User Management and create some users.

image:{images}{theme}/19_usercreate_thumb.png[link="{images}{theme}/19_usercreate.png"]

After this step you should be able to login to Zarafa WebAcess if you go to https://<your-server's-ip>/webaccess or WebApp https://<your-server's-ip>/webapp

[IMPORTANT]
==============
The language in the {product} UI has to be set for the folders in Zarafa to be created in the right language. This should be done prior to the creation of users.
==============

=== Additional Steps

When using the supported zarafa packages there will be two more packages available:

* zarafa-webaccess-muc
* zarafa-backup

These have to be installed manually for the corresponding functionality to be available.
