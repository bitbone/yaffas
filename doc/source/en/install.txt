== Installation

{product} has to be installed on a freshly set up Linux distribution.
At the moment Ubuntu 10.04/12.04, Debian 6/7 and Red Hat 5/6 are officially
supported.
The following steps describe how {product} can be installed.
There are packages available for both 32bit and 64bit architectures.

=== System requirements

  * Ubuntu Server 10.04/12.04, Debian 6/7 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5/6
  * Correctly configured fully qualified hostname
  * Static IP address

{product} can be installed on a preconfigured Zarafa system, however, please be aware that your configuration will be overwritten and that you can loose your data!

Please also make sure that your MySQL password does not contain a hash sign (#) since there is a problem with the current configuration management.

=== Procedure

{product} can be installed from the repositories described below for the two supported Linux distributions.

==== Installation on existing server

Right now the installation on an existing server is not recommended and not supported.
Before considering to go this way, either wait for one of the next releases or install on a clean machine and migrate your data to the new system.

If you still wish to install it on an existing server make sure you have a backup or make a copy of your actual machine.

To install {product} on such a system, install the packages as described
below, but skip the installation wizard (change
/opt/yaffas/etc/webmin/webmin.acl symlink to point to
webmin.acl-global instead of -setup), as it would delete all your data.

You will have to do several configuration changes on your own. You can
figure out the necessary details by inspecting the relevant resources
(/opt/yaffas/share/yaffas-upgrade/, /opt/yaffas/share/yaffas-ldap/, and
the source code of the packages as found on http://www.github.com/bitbone/yaffas/).

We invite you to ask for community support for this installation path, which we will monitor closely on the forum and possibly create a standardized procedure from this.

==== Ubuntu Server

**Adding required repositories**

ifdef::release-type-beta[]
[WARNING]
==============
This is a {product} **beta** version. The following addresses are only
valid for the beta version. Once a new version is published,
the repository URL has to be **updated manually**, otherwise **no
updates**
to newer versions will be possible.
==============
endif::release-type-beta[]

Add the following repositories in order to install {product} and required dependencies via the standard apt commands.

_Ubuntu 10.04 LTS_

[subs="attributes"]
  echo "deb http://repo.yaffas.org/{repository_prefix}lucid ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

_Ubuntu 12.04 LTS_

[subs="attributes"]
  echo "deb http://repo.yaffas.org/{repository_prefix}precise ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

Please also ensure that the https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine[+universe+ repository is enabled] (check via
+grep universe /etc/apt/sources.list+).

[NOTE]
===========

If you need a proxy to download from internet, just set the "http_proxy" variable

  export http_proxy="http://<user>:<password>@<your-proxy>:<port>"
  export HTTP_PROXY="$http_proxy"

You should later make this setting permanent by setting the proxy in the
user interface (Network &gt; Configuration &gt; HTTP Proxy).
This will also ensure that all supported services can properly use the
proxy (such as ClamAV's freshclam).

===========

**Import package key**

  wget -O - http://repo.yaffas.org/repo.deb.key | apt-key add -

**Install the packages**

[subs="attributes"]
  apt-get update
  apt-get install {product}

This will install {product} base modules and zarafa.

During the installation zarafa, mysql, openldap, postfix and many other dependencies are installed.

The package manager will usually ask questions for some packages.
You can skip all of these by pressing "enter" when the dialog pops up.
The configuration of these will be done by the {product} installation
procedure later.

Only if you are asked for a MySQL server root password you should enter a password and note it down as you will be asked for MySQL credentials when first using {product}.

image:{images_common}8_ldap_thumb.png[link="{images_common}8_ldap.png"]
image:{images_common}9_ldap_thumb.png[link="{images_common}9_ldap.png"]

For postfix configuration select the "local only" type:

image:{images_common}10_postfix_thumb.png[link="{images_common}10_postfix.png"]
image:{images_common}11_postfix_thumb.png[link="{images_common}11_postfix.png"]
image:{images_common}12_postfix_thumb.png[link="{images_common}12_postfix.png"]

Use the default values for kerberos configuration:

image:{images_common}13_kerberos_thumb.png[link="{images_common}13_kerberos.png"]
image:{images_common}14_kerberos_thumb.png[link="{images_common}14_kerberos.png"]

endif::release-type-beta[]

Add the following repositories in order to install {product} and required dependencies via the standard apt commands.

[subs="attributes"]
  echo "deb http://repo.yaffas.org/{repository_prefix}squeeze ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

[NOTE]
===========

If you need a proxy to download from internet, just set the "http_proxy" variable

==== Red Hat Enterprise Linux

The installation on Red Hat Enterprise Linux is similar.

[NOTE]
===========

If you need a proxy to download from internet, just set the "http_proxy" variable

  export http_proxy="http://<user>:<password>@<your-proxy>:<port>"
  export HTTP_PROXY="$http_proxy"

You should later make this setting permanent by setting the proxy in the
user interface (Network &gt; Configuration &gt; HTTP Proxy).
This will also ensure that all supported services can properly use the
proxy (such as ClamAV's freshclam).

===========

**Adding the required repositories**

The {product} packages will require some dependencies.
As these dependencies are not part of the standard RHEL repository, the following two repositories have to be added to the installed system.

**Repositories for RHEL 5**

Run the following command to install the EPEL repository:

  rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm

If the above referenced URL is no longer functional because a newer version
of the package is available, then you can still get the latest version from
this address:
http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/repoview/epel-release.html


Then, depending on your architecture, run the following commands to add
the RPMforge repository:

  rpm -Uvh http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el5.rf.i386.rpm

or

  rpm -Uvh http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el5.rf.x86_64.rpm

**Repositories for RHEL 6**

Run the following command to install the EPEL repository:

  rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

If the above referenced URL is no longer functional because a newer version
of the package is available, then you can still get the latest version from
this address:
http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/repoview/epel-release.html

Then, depending on your architecture, run the following commands to add
the RPMforge repository:

  rpm -Uvh http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el6.rf.i686.rpm

or

  rpm -Uvh http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el6.rf.x86_64.rpm

[NOTE]
==============

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems it is necessary to
https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/solutions/11312[subscribe] to the
"RHEL Server Optional" channel. This is not done by default.

==============

**{product} repository**

ifdef::release-type-beta[]
[WARNING]
==============
This is a {product} **beta** version. The following addresses are only
valid for the beta version. Once a new version is published,
the repository URL has to be **updated manually**, otherwise **no
updates**
to newer versions will be possible.
==============
endif::release-type-beta[]

After the extra repositories are added, the {product} repository has to added:

Create a file "{product}.repo" in folder /etc/yum.repos.d with the following contents:
[subs="attributes"]
----
[{product}]
name = {product} $releasever
baseurl = http://repo.yaffas.org/{repository_prefix}rhel/$releasever
enabled = 1
protect = 0
gpgcheck = 1
priority = 1
----

Additionally, the EPEL configuration has be to changed due to a recent
dependency problem. To do that, add the following line at the end of the
`[epel]` block in `/etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo` (after `gpgkey=...`):

  exclude=clamav* clamd* amavisd*



**Import GPG keys**

  rpm --import http://repo.yaffas.org/repo.rpm.key

**Package installation**

[subs="attributes"]
  yum install {product}

[NOTE]
================

If running the above command leads to a conflict between php-common and
php53-common on RHEL5, then this is because of a
http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=4852[packaging bug]. You can work
around this by running

  yum remove php53 php53-common
  yum install php php-ldap php-mapi php-pecl-json

before re-running

[subs="attributes"]
  yum install {product}

================

=== First steps

After installation, the {product} web interface is accessible at the following URL: `https://<your-server's-ip>:10000`

The username is "admin" and password is "yaffas".

image:{images}16_login_thumb.png[link="{images}16_login.png"]

On first login, the setup assistant will be launched.

image:{images}17_setup_thumb.png[link="{images}17_setup.png"]

[WARNING]
==============

The setup procedure will change the following settings and **data will
be deleted or overwritten**:

  * existing LDAP tree
  * slapd configuration
  * Samba configuration
  * smbldap-tools configuration
  * postfix configuration
  * zarafa configuration
  * MySQL configuration (optimizations for Zarafa will be made)

==============

The installer will ask you to change the default admin password.

image::{images}18_setup_basic_thumb.png[link="{images}18_setup_basic.png"]


Next you will have to specify a MySQL server for Zarafa. The given user must have enough persmissions to access (or create) the given database.

image:{images}19_setup_zarafa_thumb.png[link="{images}19_setup_zarafa.png"]

In the next step, the mail server parameters will be configured. A primary
mail domain (e.g. machinename.example.org) has to be configured, a smart
host (and the required authentification data) has only be specified, if
the {product} server should forward all outgoing mails to the given host.

image:{images}20_setup_mailserver_thumb.png[link="{images}20_setup_mailserver.png"]

In the last step, you have the opportunity to enable local authentication
and create a first user for your system.

image:{images}21_setup_createuser_thumb.png[link="{images}21_setup_createuser.png"]

If you decide not to create a local user now, an <<authentication-server,authentication server has to be configured>> after finishing the setup wizard.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux you also need to start the required services and configure them for automatic start at boot. This is can be done in "System -> Services".
Since by default an iptables firewall is active in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the ports for the needed services have to be opened manually.

The next step should be to <<mailserver-config,configure the mail server>>.
Without a working mail server configuration some parts of the system will not work.
It will also not be possible to create resources for Zarafa when no local domain is set for the mail server.

Now you can go Accounts -> User Management and create some users.

After this step you should be able to login to Zarafa WebAcess if you go to _https://<your-server's-ip>/webaccess_ or WebApp _https://<your-server's-ip>/webapp_

[IMPORTANT]
==============
The language in the {product} UI has to be set for the folders in Zarafa to be created in the right language. This should be done prior to the creation of users.
==============

=== Additional Steps

Additional features like brick-level backups and the Multi-User-Calendar
plugin for WebAccess can be enabled by manually installating the package
zarafa-backup or zarafa-webaccess-muc respectiveley (using +yum install+ on
RHEL and +apt-get install+ on Debian/Ubuntu).
This will only work if you have a commercial Zarafa license.
