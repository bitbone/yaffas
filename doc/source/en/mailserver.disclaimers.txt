=== E-mail disclaimers
The e-mail disclaimers module enables you to configure texts which will be
appended to all out-going mail. This can be used to implement legal
disclaimers (like "This message contains confidential information") or
signatures (like "John Doe, Example Ltd.").
The texts can be configured separately for both plaintext and HTML
mails. Disclaimers can be configured on a global, a group-specific and
a user-specific level. Group- and user-specific texts can be set up by
using the context menu (right click on a user row in the table) in the
generic user, respectively, group management tab in the "Accounts" menu.

All texts can contain special template markers, which will be replaced by
their real associated value for the current user (from LDAP) at
evaluation time (i.e. when a mail is being sent).

The following keywords will be recognized:

[options="header"]
|======
| Variable | Meaning
| $\{FULLNAME} | the user's full name (first name + last name)
| $\{GIVENNAME} | the user's first name
| $\{LASTNAME} | the user's last name
| $\{DEPARTMENT} | the user's department in the company
| $\{COMPANY} | the user's company name
| $\{PHONE} | the user's phone number
| $\{FAX} | the user's fax number
| $\{EMAIL} | the user's primary email address
| $\{FROM} | the email's From: address (might differ from $\{EMAIL}, e.g. when using aliases)
| $\{STREET} | the user's street address
| $\{POBOX} | the user's post office box
| $\{ZIP} | the user's zip code
| $\{CITY} | the user's city
| $\{STATE} | the user's state
| $\{COUNTRY} | the user's country
|======

In HTML disclaimers, all keyword data will be automatically escaped.
Invalid keywords or keywords with no associated data for the current user
will be replaced with an empty string. If the keyword was the only content
in that line, the whole line is eaten. This avoids bad looking empty
lines.
Before a disclaimer is appended to an e-mail, a line break is
inserted between the email and the disclaimer.

**Be aware** though that automatically appending disclaimers to signed or
encrypted mails (PGP/MIME or S/MIME) on a gateway can be problematic.
Although this module is able to handle these cases in a
standards-conforming way, several e-mail clients (e.g Thunderbird) have
problems recognizing the cryptographical signatures of such mangled mails.
Signed mails will still be properly displayed, but it will not be obvious
to the user that a message was signed. Encrypted mails will display
perfectly as well (at least in Thunderbird). You can work around these
problems either by stopping to use PGP/MIME or S/MIME and falling back to
PGP/Inline. This is not optimal because it is no solution for S/MIME
setups and even for PGP usage it is a step backwards as attachments are no
longer signed. The other alternative is stopping this module from touching
such mails. This works by configuring a Content-Type-based exception rule.
You can add the necessary rules in Zarafa -> E-mail disclaimers ->
Preferences -> "MIME types, which should not receive disclaimers". Simply
insert multipart/signed and/or multipart/encrypted (each on their own
line) there.

If group-specific disclaimers are used and a user is a member of multiple
groups, the groups are sorted alphabetically and the first group's
disclaimer is used.
