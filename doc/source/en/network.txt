Please type the address into the field "Proxy" and and the port of your HTTP proxy server into the second field. If your proxy needs user authentication, enter the required data in "User" and "Password". Confirm with "Save".

==== Interface Configuration
Each available interface has an own tab for it's basic settings at the "Interface" tabs.

If your network contains multiple network areas and the mail server or individual workstations are located in a different network, the default gateway must be specified.
In this case the address of your DNS server must be entered in the field "DNS Server IP".
You can also enter several search domains, which are used for resolving host names if a full name is not provided.

The settings for each interface are only active when the interface is activated.
If multiple interfaces are activated simultaneously, the settings for all interfaces can be processed.

By clicking the button "New Virtual IP Address" you can configure an additional IP address for the associated interface.
For this virtual interface you can use the same values as used for a usual interface.

The field "Access For" defines who has access to the SNMP agent. The entry "default" means, that only requests from the local machine are allowed.
