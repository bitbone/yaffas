===  Authentication Server

The menu topic _Accounts -> Authentication Server_ leads to a page for configuring the source for authentication.

ifndef::product-bitkit[]
image:{images}23_authserver_thumb.png[link="{images}23_authserver.png"]

After installation of {product} this has to be configured first because other services depend on it. Users and groups can only be created after selecting an authentication type.
endif::product-bitkit[]

{product} can use a local LDAP, a remote {product} LDAP or a Microsoft Windows Active Directory domain for authentication.

When using the local LDAP for authentication the server can also be used as (LDAP) authentication server for other remote systems.

[WARNING]
==============
When changing the authentication type all settings that apply to users will be deleted. Those settings have to be re-applied after the change.

{product} tries to find existing users in the new authentication source. Data from users that cannot be found will be deleted.
==============

To select a type of authentication choose the tab _Select authentication_ below the menu topic _Accounts -> Authentication Server_

====  Local Authentication
When choosing these method a local LDAP will be used for storing users and groups. You can optionally choose to let this server be used by other servers as authentication source.

==== Yaffas LDAP Server
If you already use another {product} server with local LDAP authentication you can enter it's connection details here. Users and groups on the remote system can then be used on the local server. 

[NOTE]
==============
A {product} server which authenticates its users against a remote server cannot act itself as an authentication server. Should this option be active it will automatically be deactivated.
==============

The following values have to be configured to run the LDAP server:
[options="header"]
|======
| Value | Function 
| Server/IP | DNS name or IP address of the remote {product} server. The remote side has to be configured to accept authentication requests. 
| Base DN | The base DN defines at which point in the LDAP-Tree a search for a certain object should be started. 
| Bind DN | The bind DN and the bind password are used for authentication against the remote LDAP server. 
| Bind password | The password for LDAP authentication. I case of problems with the authentication try using a CRYPT-hashed password. 
|======


====  Remote LDAP Authentication
You can use {product} together with any remote LDAP server. Only the schema has to be installed on the remote LDAP server. 

[options="header"]
|======
| Value | Function 
| Server/IP | Enter the remote LDAP server's IP. 
| Base DN | Enter the searchbase of you LDAP server. e.g. o=yaffas,c=org
| Bind DN | Enter the user dn that should be used for authentication against LDAP. e.g. cn=ldapadmin,ou=People,o=yaffas,c=org
| Base DN user | Enter the part of the users subtree. e.g. ou=People
| Base DN group | Enter the part of the groups subtree. e.g. ou=Groups
| Bind password | Enter the password of the Bind DN user.
| Search attribute user | Enter the attribute where user and group information should be searched for. 
|======

==== Active Directory
When using this type of authentication {product} can join an Active Directory domain. All users and groups of this domain will be available in {product}. 

[NOTE]
==============
When using Active Directory authentication it is advisable to enter the domain controller as first DNS server in the network configuration.
==============

[options="header"]
|======
| Field | Function 
| Domain Controller | Name or IP address of the Active Directory server.
| Domain | Name of the AD domain.
| Domain administrator | Username of an account with administrator privileges. Used for joining the domain. This user is searched in the cn=users organization unit.
| Username | User for readonly queries. Only this information will be saved. The domain administrator settings are only needed for joining the domain.
|======

For simple queries to the domain controller a standard user account is sufficient. Please enter the account information for this.

[WARNING]
==============
If you change the active directory user, his password or the DN of your server, you have to change those in the authentication module too!
==============

[NOTE]
==============
It is currently not possible to use an Active Directory server whose
workgroup is different than the domain.
This is being worked on. The current status along with further information
can be found in the https://jira.zarafa.com/browse/ADM-275[relevant ticket].
