= {product} documentation

== Installation


=== System requirements

  * Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  * about 22 MB of additional disk space


=== Procedure

Yaffas can be installed from the repositories described below.


==== Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS

**adding required repositories**

  echo "deb http://repo.yaffas.org/ubuntu ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
  echo "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

**import package key**

  wget -O - http://repo.yaffas.org/ubuntu/repo.key | apt-key add -

**install the packages**

  apt-get update
  apt-get install yaffas yaffas-zarafa

This will install {product} base modules and zarafa.

**optional: installing the configuration packages**

This package and its dependencies are used to make a freshly installed system manageable with {product}. Without yaffas-config, a number of manual adjustments to configuration files need to be made so the admin interface can function properly.

  apt-get install yaffas-config

Answer "yes" if the installation system asks to replace configuration files.

[WARNING]
==============

When installing the **yaffas-config** package and its dependencies, the
following settings and data will be deleted or overwritten:
 
  * existing LDAP tree
  * slapd configuration
  * Samba configuration
  * smbldap-tools configuration
  * postfix configuration
  * zarafa configuration
  * MySQL configuration (optimizations for Zarafa will be made)


==============


==== Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5

The installation on Red Hat Enterprise Linux is similar.

[WARNING]
==============

The package yaffas-config will overwrite the same configuration files as mentioned above.

==============

**adding the required repositories**

Prior to the installation of {product} Zarafa packages have to be installed. Otherwise the open source packages included in the EPEL repository will be used. Packages can  be downloaded from http://www.zarafa.com/download-release.

For automatic dependency resolution the http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL[EPEL] and http://rpmrepo.org/RPMforge[RPMforge] repositories should be included into the yum configuration.

Create a file "yaffas.repo" in folder /etc/yum.repos.d with the following contents:
----
[yaffas]
name = Yaffas $releasever
baseurl = http://repo.yaffas.org/rhel/
enabled = 1
protect = 0
gpgcheck = 0
----

**import GPG keys**

  rpm --import http://repo.yaffas.org/rhel.key

**packages installation**

  yum install yaffas yaffas-zarafa yaffas-config


=== First steps

After installation, the {product} web interface is accessible at the following URL: `https://<your-server's-ip>:10000`

The username is "admin" and password is "yaffas".

On first log in the admin password has to be changes. In addition, the user has to specify a MySQL user who has permission to create a database for Zarafa.

After the first login an authentication server should be selected. Choices are Active Directory, remote LDAP and local authentication. Please note that currently the configuration files (yaffas-config) have to be installed for this step.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux you also need to start the required services and configure them for automatic start at boot. This is can be done in "System-> Services". Since by default an iptables firewall is active in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the ports for the needed services have to be opened manually.

[IMPORTANT]
==============

The language in the {product} UI has to be set for the folders in Zarafa to be created in the right language. This should be done prior to the creation of users.

==============


== System

=== Services

==== Start and Stop Services

By selecting the menu item "services" the state of each system service can be shown. If you right click on a service, you can start, stop or re-start the service. Furthermore, you can choose to start the service by booting the system and to monitor the service. Then the admin will receive an email notification if the service fails.


==== System Time
At this tab you can manually set the system time. Time can be set with drop-down fields and be saved afterwards. If the system time shall be provided by the hardware time (BIOS), this can be done on "Synchronizing System Time with Hardware Time".


==== Time Server
Additionally, time can be synchronized with a time server. This is possible once or in hourly or daily intervals. For this purpose enter the IP address or the hostname of the time server and choose an interval.

For example, the below listed time servers can be used. The precondition is that a valid DNS server is configured.

   * time.fu-berlin.de
   * ntp0.fau.de
   * ntp1.ptb.de



==== Restart / Shutdown
At the tab "Shutdown System" you can reboot or shut down the system.



=== Certificate / Key Management

Certificates and keys are required to encrypt communications with the web interface as well as the mail traffic. They guarantee the authenticity, confidentiality and integrity of the data to third parties. Free signed SSL certificates are available at <http://www.cacert.org>.

Under the menu item "Certificate / Key Management" they can be managed. You can even create certificates and sign it with your own key. You can also import or delete existing certificates.


==== Manage Certificates
Using the tab "Manage Installed Certificates" all certificates existing on the system are displayed. If you want to delete a certificate, tick the box on the left of the certificate and click on the button "delete". The default certificate "default.crt", which is used for all services of the system, cannot be deleted.

[TIP]
==============
If you want to replace "default.crt", you must either create a new certificate for all services or import an existing certificate.
==============


==== Create Own Certificates
To create a certificate yourself, click on the tab "Generate Self Signed Certificate and Key", fill in all fields and create the certificate by clicking on "Generate Key". If you choose "all" at the drop-down field "Service", you can create a default certificate. This is always used if no other certificates are available specific to a service. All other choices ​​for "Service" create a certificate for the respective service.


==== Upload Certificates
If you want to upload an existing certificate, click on the tab "Upload Certificate" and click on "Browse" to choose the file from your hard disk.
Select the file with the certificate and click "Open". After the dialog closed itself you have to select the service to which your certificate shall apply. Finally, you should delete any remaining duplicates.

[IMPORTANT]
==============

The key and the certificate must be contained together in one file to successfully import a certificate. Please note that the key should come **first** and the file **must not be** encrypted.
==============

== Network

=== Configuration

==== Basic Configuration
Basic network configurations can be set under the menu item "Networking" -> "Configuration" at the tab "Base Settings".

[NOTE]
==============

The "Domain Name" must be formatted as required in http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt[RFC 1034] (e. g. "bitbone.de").
The "Workgroup" is required for Windows networks.
==============



==== Proxy Settings
The settings for HTTP proxy are required for downloading {product} updates if your network doesn't have a direct internet access.

Please type the IP address into the field "Proxy" and and the port of your HTTP proxy server into the second field. If your proxy needs user authentication, enter the required data in "User" and "Password". Confirm with "Save".

==== Interface Configuration
Each available interface has an own tab for it's basic settings at the "Interface" tabs.

If your network contains multiple network areas and the mail server or individual workstations are located in a different network, the default gateway must be specified. In this case the address of your DNS server must be entered in the field "DNS Server IP". You can also enter several search domains, which are used for resolving host names if a full name is not provided.

The settings for each interface are only active when the interface is activated. If multiple interfaces are activated simultaneously, the settings for all interfaces can be processed.

By clicking the button "New Virtual IP Address" you can configure an additional IP address for the associated interface. For this virtual interface you can use the same values as used for a usual interface.



=== SNMP

Click the checkbox under the menu item "Networking -> SNMP Configuration" to enable access via SNMP protocol. You can set the password for SNMP access in the field "Community".

[IMPORTANT]
==============
Using SNMP data is generally transmitted unencrypted via network.
For your own safety, please choose another password than "root" or the administrator's password!
==============

The field "Access For" defines who has access to the SNMP agent. The entry "default" means, that only requests from the local machine are allowed.

You can enter a single IP address or a subnet following the http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632[CIDR]-pattern _address/mask_ (e. g. 192.168.0.1/24).




== Accounts



===  Authentication Server

The menu topic  _"Accounts->Authentication Server"_ leads to a page for configuring the source for authentication.

After installation of {product} this has to be configured first because other services depend on it. Users and groups can only be created after selecting an authentication type.



{product} can use a local LDAP, a remote {product} LDAP or a Microsoft Windows Active Directory domain for authentication.

When using the local LDAP for authentication the server can also be used as (LDAP) authentication server for other remote systems.

[WARNING]
==============
When changing the authentication type all settings that apply to users will be deleted. Those settings have to be re-applied after the change.

{product} tried to find existing users in the new authentication source. Data from users that can not be found will be deleted.
==============



To select a type of authentication choose the tab  _"Select authentication"_ below the menu topic  _"Accounts->Authentication Server"_ 


====  Local Authentication
When choosing these method a local LDAP will be used for storing users and groups. You can optionally choose to let this server be used by other servers as authentication source.. 





==== {product} LDAP Server
If you already use another {product} server with local LDAP authentication you can enter it's connection details here. Users and groups on the remote system can then be used on the local server. 

[NOTE]
==============
A {product} server which authenticates it's users against a remote server can not act itself as an authentication server. Should this option be active it will automatically be deactivated.
==============

The following values have to be configured to run the LDAP server:
[options="header"]
|======
| Value | Function 
| Server/IP | DNS name or IP address of the remote {product} server. The remote side has to be configured to accept authentication requests. 
| Base DN | The base DN defines at which point in the LDAP-Tree a search for a certain object should be started.

*/
////

For simple queries to the domain controller a standard user account is sufficient. Please enter the account information for this.

[WARNING]
==============
If you change the active directory user, his password or the DN of your server, you have to change those in the authentication module too!
==============



=== User Management

== Mailserver



=== Fetchmail Mail Retrieval
Fetchmail is used for retrieving emails from external email accounts. You can make a new entry for fetchmail at the tab "Add Query".

"Server Name" is the designation for the settings that will be saved. If this is also the real name of the mailserver, please activate the choice box in line "Mail Server to Contact". If not, please enter the real name in this line.

Via "Polling Enabled" you can activate or deactivate retrieving mails from this mailserver. At "Protocol" you can choose the type of protocol. If the mailservice is not on the default port for the protocol, you can enter another port number at "Server Port".

At "Mailserver User Details" you can enter settings for the user, whose mails shall be retrieved. "Remote User" and "Remote Password" are the data that are sent to the mail server. You can specify at "Destination" to whom the fetched mails shall be forwarded. Choose between a local user mailbox, a mail alias or "Multidrop". In "Multidrop" mode the local part (left of the @-sign) will be evaluated and the mail will be delivered to a local user or an alias with the same name.

All other fields are optional and can be customized. 



=== Mailserver Configuration


==== Base Configuration
At the tab "Base Configuration" you can customize the configuration of your mailserver. "Mail Server Name " is the name that is sent on outgoing emails to the remote SMTP server. This setting is optional.

With the maximum mail size, the size of incoming and outgoing mails can be limited. The entry is in MB. Without this option mails of unlimited size can be sent.


==== Local Domains
At "Local Domains" you can set domains for which the mailserver will be responsible for. Emails to these domains will be accepted and delivered locally.


==== Smarthost
Enter the IP address of the mailserver of your company or the provider at the tab "Smarthost". This server will be responsible for the delivery of external emails. If this mailserver requires authentication, enter the required data in "Username" and "Password". The username must contain at least two characters!


==== Open Relay Subnets
For all addresses listed at the tab "Open Relay Subnets" external mail sending without authentication is possible. All networks (IP subnets) and computers (single IP addresses) should be entered for which external mail delivery without authentication shall be allowed.

However, sending mails to domains for which the mailserver is responsible is always possible. Example entry for activating a subnet: _"192.168.0.0/24"_ - _"/24"_ indicates the number of bits set in the netmask. The netmask would be _"255.255.255.0"_ in this case.



=== Mail Queue

The mail queue contains all emails, that could not be sent.

By right-clicking on an email, you can delete, attempt to deliver or display the selected email.



=== Mail Alias Configuration
At "Mail Alias" all set mail aliases - both the aliases of the system, as well as your own aliases - are displayed.

[TIP]
==============
When adding a mail alias please consider that the alias test is executed ** before ** the mailbox allocation. It may happen that emails will be assigned to another user although that user has a mailbox on the server. In such cases please check all set mail aliases.
==============

New aliases can be defined using the tab "Add Alias". An alias can be assigned to multiple users if you separate them by commas. A user of the {product} installation or an email address can be specified as a target.

If you want to delete an alias, please right-click on the entry in the overview at "Mail Alias" and choose "Remove".



=== Security

[IMPORTANT]
==============

The services SpamAssassin and ClamAV have to be started separately from the service module before they can be used by the security module. Activating the security services at the security module is not sufficient. If you started these services after activating them at the security module, the service "amavis" has to be restarted.

==============

[TIP]
==============

If the ClamAV service will not start, it may have no virus signatures. The freshclam service draws them automatically, but requires an internet connection. A proxy server can be configured at Network Configuration if necessary. This will cause an update of the signatures via freshclam.

==============



=== Bulk Mailing
With this module you can send an email to all users of the system. You must insert your sender mail address, the subject of the mail and the message. After clicking on the button "Send" the email will be sent to all users that have an account.

[IMPORTANT]
==============
If you want to change resource settings, you may change the properties but not the name!
==============



=== Zarafa Setup

The configuration of {product} & ZARAFA is done via the known interface. There are some specifics to explain:

As a matter of principle each user account in {product} is also a Zarafa user. Please pay attention that you have a corresponding license of {product} AND of Zarafa. If you have less Zarafa user licences than {product} users, only the users with the lowest UIDs have access to Zarafa. 


===  Allocation of Email Addresses
Please pay attention that during the creation of an user account the entry in the field  _"Email Address"_ is formatted as follows:  _"username@configured_maildomain"_  Otherwise, mail reception is not possible. If you want to use a different email address for reception, please insert it at  _"Email Alias"_ .

The registered address at  _"Email Address"_ is also used as sender for all mails sent via web access. For a proper function please set the local domain(s) on the mailserver at first(menu Mailserver-> Configuration -> Local Domains). 



=== Zarafa Web Access
Insert the URL into your browser, e.g. https://zarafaserver.local/webaccess.
Alternatively, you can choose name or IP address of {product} without mentioning a port number. (e.g. http://zarafaserver.local)

A complete manual and current documentation of Zarafa Web Access can be downloaded here: http://www.zarafaserver.com/doc.



=== Microsoft Outlook Connection

The client you need for connecting Microsoft Outlook is in   _"software"_ at the directory  _"zarafa"_ on your {product} system. Please use exactly this version of the client, because it is matched with the Zarafa version used in {product}. After updating {product} you should always take the current version of the client out of this directory.

First, install the client on the Windows computer by double-clicking on  _"zarafaclient.exe"_  Please note: You must have administration permissions.

Start Outlook and choose the topic  _"Email Accounts"_ from menu  _"Extras"_  Create a new email account.

Please make sure that the following setting is made for the new account:  _"New Messages Send to"_ must match  _"Inbox User"_  Close Outlook and start it again. Now you can access your store and use mail, calendar or contacts... . 

[NOTE]
==============
Please understand that we are not able to give support to any issue of using, configuring or installing Microsoft Outlook!
==============



=== Backup Path
At this point we show an unspecific way to backup the data of the server. For a successful recovery of the data the {product} server must be on the same level of version and patches!

the paths for the backup of {product} & ZARAFA are:
[options="header"]
|======
| path | entry 
| /var/log/ | log-files 
| /data/mail/ | mail boxes and Sieve filter scripts 
| /var/lib/fetchmail/.fetchmail-UIDL-cache | if fetchmail is used with POP3 
| Database MySQL (mysqldump) | all data of the Zarafa Server 
| /data/zarafa/ | email attachments 
|======

**Procedure for backup of data:**

  - backup of configuration via system -> save configuration
  - init 1 -> change to single user mode
  - backup of single paths in a temporary directory
  - init 2 -> normal mode of use
  - backup of data to an external data medium


**Procedure for recovery of data:**

  - recovery of configuration via system -> save configuration 
  - copy the data into a temporary directory
  - init 1 -> change to single user mode
  - delete all files below the named paths
  - restore of single paths out of the temporary directory
  - init 2 -> normal mode of use
